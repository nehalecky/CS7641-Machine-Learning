# Intro ML is the ROX

## What is machine learning?

- Computational Statistics?
- Building artifacts that learn over time with experience, that include math, science, engineering and computing. All needed to build intelligent artifacts.
- Use data to glean 

## It's about Generalization 

Machine learning is a technique for performing _inductive reasoning_, which allow for observing specific instances and forming a general rule from them. It can be referred to as bottom-up reasoning.

 
This compares to _deductive reasoning_, which proposes general hypotheses that are logical and then observes specific instances that either support or reject it.


## Major Subject Areas of class:

1. Supervised Learning: Function Approximation 
2. Unsupervised Learning: Description
3. Reinforcement Learning: Learning from Delayed Reward

These three area can be generally described as optimization problem:

1. Supervised Learning: Labels data well
2. Unsupervised Learning: Clusters / groups data well. 
3. Reinforcement Learning: Behavior scores well.
